This project is made in Android using dlib C++. 

The present work has as a proposal to develop and test a system of landing and takeoff of precision for autonomous quadrootor vehicle. The thesis aims to control the system using only computer vision techniques and monocular odometry embedded in smartphones device via Android platform, bypassing errors inherent to positioning sensors, such as GPS.

As a secondary objective, it is desired to obtain good or similar performance to conventional computers when used for the same purpose.
